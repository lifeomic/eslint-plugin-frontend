# Getting Involved

Howdy! Want to get involved by writing some cool ESLint rules? You're in the right place.

## Guidance

### Writing rules

We follow the rules outlined [by ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules), where the main directory is `lib` and `rules` live inside of that directory.

### Writing Tests

Tests live under the `tests` directory. For tests, we follow the rules outlined [by ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#rule-unit-tests-1) in their developer guides.

### Writing Suggestion Docs

Each rule should have a corresponding markdown file documenting when to use the rule and what issues it solves. These live under the `docs` directory.
